## ðŸ“š Description

Galaxy Gravity Optimization is a nature-inspired evolutionary algorithm that mimics the behavior of comets in the solar system. Each comet represents a solution and evolves through gravitational interactions, mass addition, and mass loss to find the optimal solution to a given problem.

## ðŸš€ Steps in the Algorithm

1. **Initialization**
   - Generate an initial population of comets and smaller celestial bodies.
   - Define comet properties: mass, orbit length, and fitness.

2. **Fitness Evaluation**
   - Evaluate each comet using the benchmark fitness function.

3. **Parent Selection**
   - Use roulette wheel selection to choose comets for the next generation based on fitness.

4. **Gravitational Operators**
   - **Mass Add Mutation**: Increase a comet's mass and improve its orbit based on gravitational effects.
   - **Mass Loss Mutation**: Reduce a comet's mass near the solar perigee due to proximity to the sun.

5. **Orbit Mutation**
   - Modify the orbit of comets when influenced by the gravitational pull of larger celestial bodies.

6. **Fitness Calculation**
   - Calculate the total fitness of the comet population based on the length and properties of their orbits.

7. **Replacement and Iteration**
   - Replace weaker comets with better-performing ones and repeat the process for a fixed number of iterations.

8. **Convergence**
   - Track and plot the best fitness values over iterations.
